                    The We Were Here franchise was developed by Total Mayhem Games. The first game "We Were Here" was
                    released on Feb. 3, 2017. The original game "We Were Here" was developed as a part of a student
                    project at Rotterdam University in the Netherlands. It was submitted to the Independent Games
                    Festival in 2018. However, it won Best Indie Game Award in 2017. The studio started as just fifteen
                    students from the university and continued on the following years to make 3 sequels to the original
                    We Were Here game. Sequels; We Were Here Too, We Were Here Together, and We Were Here Forever.

                    We Were Here is the 1st of 4 games in the franchise. You and a friend are separated in a frigid
                    castle and must communicate through walkie-talkies (in game) or just by using another communication
                    service such as Discord (preferred). But, communication is key, this game is not possible to play
                    without talking to each other. As you make your way through each puzzle each player must describe in
                    detail different pictures, symbols, floor layout, valves, etc... and must use said information to
                    solve puzzles in the respected rooms. If you enjoy puzzle games, this is the golden standard of
                    co-op puzzle games. Another bonus is that the first game of the series is currently FREE, and is
                    expected to stay that way!

                <h3>We Were Here Too</h3>
                <p>
                    The second game in the series. You and a friend play as a different pair of explorers and traverse
                    into the same castle as the previous game. You are separated once again and have to communicate to
                    get out. This game is about double the length comared to the first game in the series. Choose wisely
                    though as there are 2 endings to this game, one of you may be left behind...

                <h3>We Were Here Together</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the third game in the series and has you and a friend playing again as two different
                    explorers. However, you start out in a snowy base this time and recieve a call for help from what is
                    determined to be the castle. The explorers head into the castle, and you guessed it, they have to
                    communicate to solve puzzles once again. Have I mentioned this was a puzzle game? Anyways, This part
                    actually reveals a lot more to the story than the two previous games and there are several cutscens
                    that are played which are unique to each player. I will keep the ending to this one a secret as I
                    want to spoil as little as possible.

                <h3>We Were Here Forever</h3>
                <p>
                    The last game in the series, We Were Here Forever. This game is different however. You and your
                    friend do not solve puzzles in a castle for hours. Instead, you solve puzzles in many different
                    areas, including the castle, for many hours. I don't have much more to say other than if you think
                    you are good at puzzles, you aren't. This game will take about 3 times as long as the second game in
                    the series. Not only because the puzzles are generally more difficult but there are many more
                    puzzles through the game.
