                    Overall, the We Were Here Series is the best co-op puzzle game(s) I have ever played. I highly
                    reccommend giving them a try. I will say do not cheat on the puzzles unless you are literally losing
                    your mind. Once you solve them you will feel great, good brain exercise too. If you need hints or
                    walkthroughs I reccommend just to send your partner a(n) screenshot(s) on discord to help you solve
                    them.

                <h3>We Were Here Too</h3>
                <p>
                    The second game in the series. You and a friend play as a different pair of explorers and traverse
                    into the same castle as the previous game. You are separated once again and have to communicate to
                    get out. This game is about double the length comared to the first game in the series. Choose wisely
                    though as there are 2 endings to this game, one of you may be left behind...

                <h3>We Were Here Together</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the third game in the series and has you and a friend playing again as two different
                    explorers. However, you start out in a snowy base this time and recieve a call for help from what is
                    determined to be the castle. The explorers head into the castle, and you guessed it, they have to
                    communicate to solve puzzles once again. Have I mentioned this was a puzzle game? Anyways, This part
                    actually reveals a lot more to the story than the two previous games and there are several cutscens
                    that are played which are unique to each player. I will keep the ending to this one a secret as I
                    want to spoil as little as possible.

                <h3>We Were Here Forever</h3>
                <p>
                    The last game in the series, We Were Here Forever. This game is different however. You and your
                    friend do not solve puzzles in a castle for hours. Instead, you solve puzzles in many different
                    areas, including the castle, for many hours. I don't have much more to say other than if you think
                    you are good at puzzles, you aren't. This game will take about 3 times as long as the second game in
                    the series. Not only because the puzzles are generally more difficult but there are many more
                    puzzles through the game.
