                <h3>Legends</h3>
                <p>
                    In Apex Legends you play as a "Legend" which is just one of many playable characters in the game.
                    Each legend has their own quirks to them. Every one has a different set of abilities and uses. It's
                    important to find one you like to use and learn their abilities.

                <h3>Maps</h3>
                <p>
                    There are actually multiple playable maps in Apex Legends. To date there have been 5 total maps.
                    Only 3 are currently in the rotation. As in rotation, the map for the current gamemode i.e
                    Duos/Trios, rotate every hour.

                <h3>Backstory</h3>
                <p>
                    Apex Legends actually has an entire backstory to the battle royale. The back story is very similar
                    to The Hunger Games. The game is set after a war and each legend competes in the games which are
                    televised. The games are also ran by the "Mercenary Syndicate".
