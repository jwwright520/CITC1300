        <h2>Windows?</h2>

        <p>
            To start, casinos do not have windows. Well atleast not in the gaming areas. You might be suprised by this,
            or may even question it. But, most casinos do not have windows. Why? Good question! Casinos have their ways
            of retaining people, more importantly the players. One way to achieve retention is to have no windows to the
            outside. This is so people who are playing and gambling away their money will continue for longer because
            without being able to see out of a window, their internal clocks can't keep time as well. To add to having
            no windows, casinos also do not have clocks. This again is to keep people in the casino for longer without
            them knowing. Yes, you can still wear a watch and have your smartphone. It's not like they prevent you from
            knowing the time, but when you are gambling you will forget to check the time as your focus is fully on your
            money.

        <h3>Free drinks!</h3>

        <img src="images/drink_service.jpg" alt="drink_service">

        <p>
            Another tactic casinos use is offering FREE drinks. Yes, you read that correctly FREE. As long as you are
            either at a table game, or video game such as a slot machine or video poker, a server will approach you and
            ask if you'd like a drink. And they are completely free, but they do appreciate tips. I actually went to Las
            Vegas over the summer for my first time, and this suprised me. The fact that I could get a free beverage of
            my choice for a dollar(tip) sounded almost too good to be true. It's also not just water, or soft drinks,
            but you can order mixed drinks, cocktails, bottled drinks, and so on. Technically, my thought was correct,
            it is too good to be true. The reason casinos offer this is due to
            the <a href="https://www.casino.org/features/house-edge/" target="_blank">Casino's Edge</a> on all games.
            They actually profit by giving out free drinks to only people that are playing. The casino feed the players
            alcoholic beverages which in turn causes the players to either stay longer, or play worse. Let me tell you,
            it will do both.
