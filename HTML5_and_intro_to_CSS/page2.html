            The most noticable games in the casino are the slot machines. They are colorful, noisy, and easy to play.
            You simply put your money in and push a button, THATS IT! Sounds easy right? Well, the slot machines are one
            of the worst games if you're looking to make money. Slots are literally rigged! Yes, you will win some,
            however, you will lose a lot more. The reason slots are one of the most played games is that they are
            inviting and easy to play. Anyone can play a slot machine, but not everyone can play poker. The house edge
            on slots can be up to 15%! That means on average 15% of all the money you put into the slot machine will be
            lost. So if you played $1,000 you would come out with $850.

            difficult to do, but also can get you banned from many casinos. However, there is an alternative. Blackjack
