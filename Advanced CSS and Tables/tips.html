                <p>
                    The We Were Here series will have you scratching your head, pulling out your own hair, crying, and
                    many more things that show annoyance and aggrivation. However, I will give you a few tips and tricks
                    so hopefully atlease 2 of those things don't happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First I reccomend you start the games in order, especially since the first game is totally free and
                    will give
                    you a little insight on how the rest of the games are going to work and what you will need to
                    communicate to your partner. All of the games have you communicating similar things to solve
                    puzzles, so when you get stuck, and you will... many times, you will have a general understanding of
                    what you need to look for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, I reccomend each player to have a pen and a few pieces of paper ready as there are things
                    that you will need to remember, and having it written down will prevent you from going back and
                    forth to communicate. A pen and paper are absolutely not required, but it is a golden tip for those
                    who want to play the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, now this might be a no-brainer, but communicate clearly and describe things in detail. There
                    are several parts in the game where you need to describe objects, paintings, levers, codes, and
                    other puzzle-ly things to your partner. If you don't describe these things in detail, then either
                    you and your partner will probably become enemies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fourth, if you are feeling stuck, thoroughly check the room you are in for any interactive item,
                    books, or symbols, many times you are stuck because you did not see something in the room/rooms.
                    This also falls back on the 3rd point, because if you or your partner do not describe what they see
                    in detail then you will not undertsand what to look for. All puzzles require no outside knowlege,
                    and everything you need to solve the puzzles are in either your room or your partner's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, PATIENCE. Have you already described something, well describe it again, and again. While
                    playing the game I cannot tell you how many times both me and my friend had to re-describe things we
                    saw until we figured out the next step in the puzzle. Sit back, take a deep breath, enjoy the
                    soundtrack, describe what is in the room and you will solve it eventually. Check the review page to
                    see how long each game generally takes... give or take.
                </p>

                <h3>We Were Here Too</h3>
                <p>
                    The second game in the series. You and a friend play as a different pair of explorers and traverse
                    into the same castle as the previous game. You are separated once again and have to communicate to
                    get out. This game is about double the length comared to the first game in the series. Choose wisely
                    though as there are 2 endings to this game, one of you may be left behind...

            <div class="col">
                <h3>We Were Here Together</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the third game in the series and has you and a friend playing again as two different
                    explorers. However, you start out in a snowy base this time and recieve a call for help from what is
                    determined to be the castle. The explorers head into the castle, and you guessed it, they have to
                    communicate to solve puzzles once again. Have I mentioned this was a puzzle game? Anyways, This part
                    actually reveals a lot more to the story than the two previous games and there are several cutscens
                    that are played which are unique to each player. I will keep the ending to this one a secret as I
                    want to spoil as little as possible.

                <h3>We Were Here Forever</h3>
                <p>
                    The last game in the series, We Were Here Forever. This game is different however. You and your
                    friend do not solve puzzles in a castle for hours. Instead, you solve puzzles in many different
                    areas, including the castle, for many hours. I don't have much more to say other than if you think
                    you are good at puzzles, you aren't. This game will take about 3 times as long as the second game in
                    the series. Not only because the puzzles are generally more difficult but there are many more
                    puzzles through the game.
