                            This game is just a taste of what the next games in the series have to offer. After playing
                            this with a friend we were both hooked and immedietely bought the series bundle because we
                            knew this series was golden. 8/10 ----- Play time: 1.5hrs

                            The second game in the series. I was just as happy as I was with the last one. The game is
                            longer, there are more puzzles, and the visuals of the game are really good. However, some
                            of the puzzles in this game were either too easy, or I just got better at solving them. 9/10
                            ----- Play time: 3.5hrs

                            The Third game in the series... well... if you didnt get frustrated at puzzles in the other
                            games, you will in this one. Pros: More puzzles, deeper story. Cons: there are a couple
                            puzzles that absolutely destroyed my mental well-being, to the point where I had to take a
                            break. However, after I completed them I got a crazy puzzle-confidence boost. I love co-op
                            puzzle games and this is no exception, but, this one is probably my least favorite in the
                            series. 7/10 ----- Play time: 6.4hrs
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            Ahh, the final game in the series. This one did not dissapoint. Puzzles were excellent, a
                            few mind tugging puzzles, an awesome story, and great visuals. The only thing that could
                            make this game better would be if it didn't end. This game is the best by far out of the
                            series and had me and my friend playing it for hours until we had to take breaks to sleep.
                            Some puzzles were pretty difficult, but none were insanely hard. 10/10 ----- Play time:
                            12.8hrs
                        </td>

                </table>

                <p>
                    Overall, the We Were Here Series is the best co-op puzzle game(s) I have ever played. I highly
                    reccommend giving them a try. I will say do not cheat on the puzzles unless you are literally losing
                    your mind. Once you solve them you will feel great, good brain exercise too. If you need hints or
                    walkthroughs I reccommend just to send your partner a(n) screenshot(s) on discord to help you solve
                    them.

                <h3>We Were Here Too</h3>
                <p>
                    The second game in the series. You and a friend play as a different pair of explorers and traverse
                    into the same castle as the previous game. You are separated once again and have to communicate to
                    get out. This game is about double the length comared to the first game in the series. Choose wisely
                    though as there are 2 endings to this game, one of you may be left behind...

                <h3>We Were Here Together</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the third game in the series and has you and a friend playing again as two different
                    explorers. However, you start out in a snowy base this time and recieve a call for help from what is
                    determined to be the castle. The explorers head into the castle, and you guessed it, they have to
                    communicate to solve puzzles once again. Have I mentioned this was a puzzle game? Anyways, This part
                    actually reveals a lot more to the story than the two previous games and there are several cutscens
                    that are played which are unique to each player. I will keep the ending to this one a secret as I
                    want to spoil as little as possible.

                <h3>We Were Here Forever</h3>
                <p>
                    The last game in the series, We Were Here Forever. This game is different however. You and your
                    friend do not solve puzzles in a castle for hours. Instead, you solve puzzles in many different
                    areas, including the castle, for many hours. I don't have much more to say other than if you think
                    you are good at puzzles, you aren't. This game will take about 3 times as long as the second game in
                    the series. Not only because the puzzles are generally more difficult but there are many more
                    puzzles through the game.
